aleph.

1. processor/synth. sound/audio computer.
2. expansive i/o. connected.
3. modular operating system. dynamic control patching.
4. open source.



a music computer. open source noise device.


+ dynamic program. 
	echo, synth, filter, drum machine, etc.
	open source = user designed, community driven
	sdcard

+ flexible interface
	four encoders, four keys, two footswitch
	CV input and output, 10V
	screen
	usb device = computer communication
	usb host
		hid midi = keyboard, knob box, drum pad, MIDI ports
		monomes
	inter-device communication = i2c (needs a name?)

+ adaptable interaction.
	complex or simple program interface
	assignable parameter mapping
	parameter transformation, automation, sequencing
	preset
	
+ audio
	high fidelity audio i/o
	gain stages with LED meters
	quad outputs and inputs
		individual outs for drum/synth/loop voices
		analog inserts
