get the toolchain and header files from atmel.com.

currently the page is here, (but it could move)
http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATMELAVRTOOLCHAINFORLINUX.aspx
you will need to sign up / login.

get the appopriate toolchain release for your architecture, and the latest headers,
now you have 2 files similar to:

avr32-gnu-toolchain-3.4.1.348-linux.any.x86.tar.gz
avr-headers-3.2.3.970.tar.gz

GET 32 BIT

extracting the toolchain archive gives you something like 
avr32-gnu-toolchain-linux_x86/

move/rename this directory however you like and make sure the binaries are in your $PATH

extracting the headers gives you
avr-headers-3.2.3.970/

move or copy the headers subdirectories avr/ and avr32/ to the avr32/include/ subdirectory of the toolchain location.
no, i have no idea why atmel chose to do it this way!

here is an example of the whole process:


cd ~/Downloads

tar -xzf avr32-gnu-toolchain-3.4.1.348-linux.any.x86_64.tar.gz
unzip -xzf avr-headers-3.2.3.970.zip

mv avr32-gnu-toolchain-linux_x86_64 ~/avr32-gnu-toolchain
echo "PATH="\$PATH:~/avr32-gnu-toolchain/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
PATH=$PATH:~/avr32-gnu-toolchain/bin

cd avr-headers-3.2.3.970
cp avr/ ~/avr32-gnu-toolchain/include/ -R
cp avr32/ ~/avr32-gnu-toolchain/include/ -R


you should now be able to run 'make' from aleph/avr32 and produce aleph.elf. yeah!
let me know if there are problems: emb@catfact.net

in order to actually program the avr32 though, we unforunately need to install "AVR32 Studio" from atmel, which is an eclipse plugin. some binary tools only included in this package are required.

http://www.atmel.com/tools/avr32studio2_6.aspx

e.g. my .bashrc contains the line
PATH=$PATH:~/as4e-ide/plugins/com.atmel.avr.utilities.linux.x86_64_3.0.0.201009140848/os/linux/x86_64/bin

BTW: i'm now including a stripped copy of the ASF in our git because it is sometimes most expedient to hack it. 
so you don't need to worry about installing that.
you may want to get a fresh copy of the ASF for development though;
if you want to use any additional resources from it, copy and add them to our git.
