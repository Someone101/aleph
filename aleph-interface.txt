////////////////////// general notes

lists
	for top/bottom, show blank space
	cursor stay in same place? list moves?
	
presets
	need new term/name instead of "preset"
	may be useful to split preset with sub-groups. 10-02 for example.
	perhaps preset-file (series) should be in setup if it is primarily for backup?
	allows for next/pre, next/group etc. song structure etc.
