followup text details for web, pulled from forum posts. post update photos.
new video (loop cutter w/ 64, cv out, gamepad, midi keys, synth) several, not just one vid, spread out
accounting, payroll, projections-- more details after meeting on wednesday
proto building-- new face, new primary, final checks 
mechanical-- fixes/updates to metal parts, knob/key
packaging w/ giffin
final part sourcing (sdcards)
programming-- monome apps, interface assist, bees assist, dsp assist, i2c
host serial communication-- laptop-based editor-- talk to peter? serial to osc.
production management-- get manufacturers started
production process-- how to make stuff here




e todo
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BEES

- rendering
  reconcile with new region-based screen system

- check scene recall
  - memory allocation bug probably culprit but need test
  - need serialization of op data, etc,
    to keep scene recall working between builds...

- more operators...


CONTROL

- midi management

- audio load/stream
  - more investigations: streaming from sd card is so totally doable.

- aleph/host communication 
  - at the very least, report bfin params to host 
    and accept direct parameter changes
  - probably also some way for apps to define custom host control handles   

- malloc
  - fix the fucking memory map / link options to assign SRAM to heap section.
    i tried and failed at this once before, could use a fresh set of eyes


DSP

- mono/poly
  - add filter
  - add envelope routing /scaling
    probably just one env with separate scaling // offset? hm
  - more / better wavetables and/or shaping

- grain engine
  - fill-buffer for grain

- noise
  - large bank of chaotic maps
  - envelopes / integrators

- lines
  - "crossfade" on position change
    ( ramp between pre/write values )

- dsyn
  - short delays would be good
  - use audio inputs more interestingly
    (ex: 3/4 for saturation/feedback within the filter structure)

- "sampler"
  - ???
  
- analysis
  - fft
    - crude pitch detection (peak bin) is probably enough
    - centroid (weighted avg of bins)
    - whiteness (distribution of bins)
    
    
- phys. modelling
  - K-S / coupled oscillation with analog feedback path
  - waveguide
