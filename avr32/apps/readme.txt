this is the avr32 apps folder.

each app can implement a specialized UI on the avr32.

../src contains modules for handling most lower-level functions.
include and/or copy at will.


FIXME:
you may see absurdities like apps/apps/src and apps/src, full of object files.
 this is the doing of the ASF makefile;
someone nees to get into that thing and fix the substitution command...
