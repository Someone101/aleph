this folder contains sources and build products for the bf533 portion of the system.

contents:

./core/ - contains routines and definitions shared by all audio apps.

./modules/ - contains individual folders for each processing app. each app gets a subfolder, a makefile, and a process_data.c, in addition to whatever sub-modules it needs.

at the moment, build objects are .o files, and live in the same directory as their sources; all builds happen from within the module subfolders. in the future, the core routines could become a single static library.
